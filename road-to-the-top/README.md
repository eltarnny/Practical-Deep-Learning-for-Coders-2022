This is a project by Jeremy Howard for the [Paddy Doctor: Paddy Disease Classification](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/paddy-disease-classification) Kaggle Competition.  

It is presented in his lectures:  
[Lesson 5: Practical Deep Learning for Coders 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_rXzeWq4C6w)  
[Lesson 6: Practical Deep Learning for Coders 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdhG64NF76E)  
[Lesson 7: Practical Deep Learning for Coders 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4ZZq0736Po)  

The files and the lectures explain Jeremy's process on how someone tackles a real life image classification problem using the competition as an example.  

You can find a wealth of information like a notebook explaining [The best vision models for fine-tuning](https://www.kaggle.com/code/jhoward/the-best-vision-models-for-fine-tuning)  

I have taken the clean notebook files and cleaned them even further from any Kaggle code, so they can be tested locally. 
I have also added comments in the code, and tried some things myself.  
I did not test the final lines of the 3rd file, as my PC copuld not run them, but you can see some usefull GPU memory related stuff with here.  
4th file markdown is Jeremy's comments, as I could not run locally most of the code.

You can find Jeremy's full notebooks here:

Unfortunately I cannot upload competition dataset nor the saved models.
